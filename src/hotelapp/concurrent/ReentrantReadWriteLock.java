 * A custom reentrant read/write lock that allows:

 * 2) One writer (when nobody else is writing or reading).
 * 3) A writer is allowed to acquire a read lock while holding the write lock.
 * 4) A writer is allowed to acquire another write lock while holding the write lock.
 * 5) A reader can not acquire a write lock while holding a read lock.
 *
 * Use ReentrantReadWriteLockTest to test this class.
